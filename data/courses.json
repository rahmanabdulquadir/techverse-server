C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.C is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.By learning C, you can be able to understand and visualize the inner workings of computer systems. This can include aspects like allocation and memory management along with their architecture and the overall concepts that drive programming.",
